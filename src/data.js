    "blog_description": "In a community group I attend, a woman in her late 40’s talked about her struggle with depression. She explained that her two children were both almost out of the house, and she didn’t know who she was anymore. She had a career, before being sidelined by an illness, so her entire life revolved around her children, and when they left, who would she be? Some of us find our purpose through raising children, but them they grow up and leave home. Some of us have careers we love and feel fulfilled, and then retire. And then what? How do we continue to find purpose through all of life’s changes? Some people find fulfillment through volunteering, and some find it through continually learning.",

With this in mind, it’s imperative to find ways to maintain our workout routines even when our lives become unbalanced. There’s no better time to get creative and think out of the box!",

    "blog_description": "What is a “superfood”? Most doctors and nutritionists will tell you that there is no scientific definition of “superfood,” that it is a marketing buzzword applied to foods that are good for you.

Medical, agrees but says: “While it is true that there is no legal or medical specification for a ‘superfood,’ it is without question that there are foods that are high in healthful nutrients and adding them to your diet may reduce your risk of chronic disease and improve your overall health and well-being.",

    "blog_description": "According to the Mayo Clinic laughter can be a major health benefit. That is no joke. While humor can’t cure all ailments, there is mounting evidence of the positive things it can do. In the short term it can stimulate the heart, lungs, and muscles, while increasing the endorphins that are released to the brain. We have all experienced how laughter can reduce stress. A good sense of humor can, in the long run, improve the immune system by releasing neuropeptides that fight stress. It can help relieve pain. Laughter can reduce stress, depression, and anxiety.",
